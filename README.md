## My ML Projects
I wanted to create some DIY projects to apply my learning in ML, so here you go:

Hogya bhai customer churn, ChatGPT, Daniel Bourke bhai, sklearn ki goated libraries aur mere pyaare GFG ki algorithm explaining ka bhot bhot dhanyawaad. Damn, it actually predicts with the 5 algorithms I learned. Once a legend said, "ML mei kya h, 4 algorithm h bass, woh lagane aane chahiye."

But no, data cleaning, preprocessing, splitting is a thing, and deployment is where your feature columns come into the picture. GG!!

**Projects Completed:**
- **Churninator3000:** Done
- **PixelPolice:** Done (21-09-2024)
- **VibeChecker:** Done (22-09-2024)
- **TrendProphet:** Done (22-09-2024)

Got to learn a lot with each and every single project, especially time series forecasting — it’s a crazy thing!

#### Research Material
I would suggest reading all the GFG articles about the different algorithms. Watch some classy popular videos by YouTubers, and I assure you, everything from basic math to probability to complex algorithms — it's all soooo beautiful!
